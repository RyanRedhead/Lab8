#Debugging

There was a lot of debugging required for this lab. First, the sensors seemed to work fine with the LEDS and then as soon as I had them dectect a wall, it became really iffy. I tried alot of different ways of coding. First was to use the front wall and left wall sensors. Finally, I stuck with just using the front sensor and just turning a certain way when it meets a wall.

#Testing Methedology/Results

Required: I used the center wall and a count number. For every wall the plan was to count it and make a specific turn. It ended up only making it to the required door.
